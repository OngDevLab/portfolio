                    <div class="viewSummary">
                        <h4>Every year, P&G held a hackathon where the top data scientists
                            in P&G would compete in a machine learning task. In 2023, 
                            the task was to classify audio samples as running water or noise.
                            This is useful for behavioral research studies and sustainability
                            studies. The competition consisted of over 100 participating data 
                            scientists. I came in first place overall. 
                        </h4>
                        <h3>The process I used to win the hackathon: </h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Clean Training Data: </strong> 
                                The data provided had many artifiacts and misclassifications.
                                I manually combed the data and created a filtering function to 
                                remove incorrect samples. I also recorded my own sample data 
                                to enhance my training dataset.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>Physics: </strong>
                                Since the data was for detecting when a person would open 
                                or shut off a faucet, I timed and calculated the rise time 
                                for the action, resulting in having the optimal window size 
                                for my audio samples. 
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>Using the full depth of data available: </strong>
                                The standard approach to audio classification was to 
                                bucket data into small samples, and doing a grid search of 
                                different frequency bands and building a simple classifier. 
                                Instead of this approach, I used the VGG19 transfer learning 
                                image classifier and used the mel spectrogram audio representation 
                                (this is the thumbnail image) and fed that result into the classifier.
                                The spectrogram allowed for time and frequency representations to 
                                be represented in the data.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>Big, Big Supercomputer: </strong>
                                Since I was a Kubernetes admin for the cluster, I had 
                                access to over three V100 GPU's and eight T4 GPU's. With 
                                this compute power, I was able to run and build my model in 
                                a weekend. 
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>Tuned Mass Damper inspired Mean Smoothing: </strong>
                                I had used traditional mean smoothing techniques, but kept
                                seeing the smoothing fail in a predictable way. 
                                After seeing the pattern of the fails, I realized that the failure 
                                looked like the graph of a tuned mass damper equation from my engineering
                                days. After implementing the function, the smoothing improved my classification
                                by five percent.

                                97% F1 Score, over 10% gap in accuracy compared to runner up.

                                This project had many components of the data science
                                workflow. I had to do the data cleaning and acquisition,
                                find domain expertise, build the best suited model, and filter
                                the output noise.

                                During the hackathon, I had to find many experts from inside 
                                the company and from external resources. In addition, I had to
                                then take a tour at the end of competition to present to various
                                executives in the company.

                                the reasoning behind not compressing to mp3, building fourier transforms,
                                and other filtering tricks allowed me to focus my time on the ML/AI tasks
                                at hand and not on the basic theory.
