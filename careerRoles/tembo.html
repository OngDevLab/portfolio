                        <h4>How I got this contract role is a very fun story! Set up a conference
                            call with me if you are interested in hearing it! I joined Tembo for 
                            a role because of two aspects: Open Source and Databases. Tembo had
                            both, as an open source Postgres extensions company. I had done 
                            many data science contracts in the past, and wanted more experience in 
                            data engineering and developer advocacy.

                        <h3>These were my three responsibilities: </h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Outreach and Lead Generation: </strong> 
                                I tested multiple lead generating strategies, including
                                outreach with the mayor of Cincinnati, going to conferences, 
                                meeting small businesses, connecting with old P&G colleagues,
                                and finally what worked best: Twitter Growth.

                            <li><strong>Write Guides and Documentation: </strong>
                                I have a programming background, so instead of completely focusing
                                on writing copy, I had another aspect where I wrote guides for 
                                using the open source Kubernetes Operator and writing connection guides
                                to and from Postgres to various programming languages. You can see my

                                I did have the opportunity to utilize some data science in my role.
                                I was able to segment the market with clustering and build specific marketing
                                strategies for different target niches.

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Web Development:</strong>
                                I had much greater focus in coding while writing the 
                                guides. Through the guide writing, I became far more
                                interested in web developent and began to understand
                                the inner workings of the web.

                            <li><strong>Cloud-hosted: Kubernetes</strong>
                                Since I was communicating and writing guides for enterprise
                                clients regarding on-prem use of the Kubernetes operator,
                                I had to take a deep dive on k8s on the big three clouds providers:
                                GCP GKE, Azure AKS, AWS EKS.

                                My core role was marketing and driving signups. During my contract,
                                I had posted the highest signup numbers (the main success metric) and
                                aided in multiple in-flight deals and partnerships with companies such as 
                                FerretDB (Postgres Open Source MongoDB alternative).
