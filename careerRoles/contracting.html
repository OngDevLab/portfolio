                        <h4>I have done contracting roles since 2010 in various industries, roles, 
                            and responsibilities. As my skillset grows, I often take on contracts 
                            to gain further experience in new spaces, while offering my clients
                            a unique blend of having a diverse toolkit and high adaptability.
                            Below are the types of roles I have taken, with company names listed
                            based on the type of disclosure agreement:

                            <li><strong>Software Developer Advocate: </strong> 
                                I had a contracting role where I managed growth and signups
                                at a startup. In this role, I developed an effective twitter
                                growth strategy, had the highest daily signups during my time
                                in role, and wrote guides and technical documentation. The 
                                technical documentation consisted of connection guides in node.js,
                                python, go, postgres, rails, etc. In addition, I wrote guides on
                                the Kubernetes operator. See

                            <li><strong>TikTok Growth Consulting: </strong>
                                I've had various roles with TikTok account growth. This started 
                                primarily in 2021, where I began to do TikTok consulting with P&G
                                internally. Eventually, since I was actually in the engineering
                                division at the time, I had to lower my time allotment to TikTok
                                consulting in P&G. I, however, still enjoyed TikTok consulting, 
                                so I began to take on clients for brand deals on videos and TikTok
                                strategy.See

                            <li><strong>Data Science/ML for Finance </strong>
                                I had a role where I served as an R&D data scientist overseas in a large
                                Singapore bank. I provided consulting on new data models and machine learning
                                algorithms that could help the business. I also wrote some MVP projects
                                for their teams. This company chose not to disclose their name.
                            </li>

                            <li><strong>RF Design Engineering: </strong>
                                I had a contract to design radiated emmissions mitigation hardware for 
                                EU CE compliance for a large US computer manufacturer. My responsibilities
                                included performing the standard tests on the VNA and S parameter analysis,
                                electromagnetic FEM modeling, and the hardware design to mitigate the emissions.
                                This company made me sign a lengthy NDA, so I'm not disclosing their name.

                                I saw a gap in my skillset at one point in my career: sales. I wanted to gain 
                                valuable experience in sales and marketing, so I ended up taking a short term 
                                assignment at Vector Marketing, a subsidiary of Alcas Corporation, that manufactures
                                Cutco knives. In my time at the company, I was ranked in the top 15 highest performing
                                salesmen. See

                            <li><strong>Real Estate: </strong>
                                I began my career in 2010, helping with the family real estate business. My focus was
                                mainly on the backend, where I handled analytics and tracked the performance of our
                                marketing campaigns. In addition, I also had responsibilities for door-to-door advertising,
                                where I A/B tested multiple flyer types and advertising vectors. In addition,
                                I designed all the signage and digital assets for the business. See

                                My contracting roles came primarily from having

                                During most of my contract roles, I often rely heavily on my
                                data science skillset. It's one of my strongest expertise areas
                                and my clients often cite my combination of data science with a 
                                behavioral science tilt as a winning combination.

                                electronic hardware, engineering, and 2D graphic design result in 
                                clear communication between clients and their stakeholders when 
                                using my software and MVP products.
