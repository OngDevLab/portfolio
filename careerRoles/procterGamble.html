                        <h4>I worked at Proctor and Gamble in the engineering divison, but had 
                            responsibilities in Brand, R&D, and IT. After my TikTok had started
                            to climb past the sizes of all the other P&G TikTok accounts, the brand 
                            divisions took notice. In addition, I had a teaching role which resulted 
                            in over 150 citizen developers trained. In total, my efforts delivered
                            over $45 million in value.
                        </h4>
                        <h3>I have selected a few notable projects: </h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Data Science and Data Engineering Tutoring Program: </strong> 
                                I created a tutoring program where any division working on any 
                                brand could get my programming support. Not only did my students 
                                get trained in Databricks and SQL, but since I made the projects 
                                interactive and based on their current work, the tutoring became 
                                full automation projects. In total, from tutoring, we delivered 
                                100+ automation projects, each with an average savings value of ~$500k.

                            <li><strong>Manufacturing Data Search Engine: </strong>
                                When working in the plants, I had noticed a deep disconnect between the 
                                machine operators and the data scientists analyzing the machine.
                                I sought to build a piece of software to bridge the gap. 
                                As a result, I built the MVP for and led an 8 person team to deliver 
                                a manufacturing data search engine for the entire company. 
                                The tool is projected to save P&G around $16 million a year.

                            <li><strong>Audio Classification AI: </strong>
                                After winning the <a href="https://ongdevlab.github.io/portfolio/projects/audioHackathon.html"><strong>P&G 2023 Deep Learning Hackathon</strong></a>,
                                I had the opportunity to scale the tool to the US and Europe. In addition
                                I had a team of three developers that worked with me to build a hardware 
                                device to track shaving usage. The AI reached an F1 score of 97% and held 
                                even with new data. 
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>TikTok Consulting: </strong>
                                I had developed a <a href="https://ongdevlab.github.io/portfolio/projects/tiktok.html"><strong>TikTok optimization software</strong></a>
                                over a few weekends, and the system started to make us go viral.
                                Eventually, P&G top brass took notice and had me consult and aid in 
                                TikTok strategy for the entire Swiffer brand. We analyzed thousands of 
                                TikTok's and developed a repeatable and captivating strategy for the brand.

                            <li><strong>Navigating Corporate Environments:</strong>
                                I took some time learning the ropes as an employee, but 
                                I finally found a niche I enjoyed. Ironically, after learning 
                                what I liked in terms of work, I went back to contracting! 
                                However, now, I am equipped with the ability to traverse
                                large organizations from the outside. 
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>Python: </strong>
                                95% of my work was done in Python building data pipelines.
                                I love doing the flashy machine learning model, but the reality
                                is these large companies have so many issues that just need one 
                                big pandas function.

                            <li><strong>Managing Expectations: </strong>
                                Often, corporate clients prefer a soft sell with solid 
                                data backing. In addition, some of this data would get skewed
                                in the media. It is a fine-line skill to manage an executive's 
                                expectations of new technology.
